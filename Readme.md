Created variables to represent the options that can be chosen: numbers, special char, lower case and upper case that can be generated in the event of a 'click.

Then it was a matter of making it random using math.floor. and math.random.

Then it was giving the user options on how they would like to combine variables into a password 8-126 characters long

I configured the prompt into letting the user choose which combination they wanted to generate with the options used in the basic letter/number options seen in the console log.
